/*
LEVEL ONE
Write a function that takes in the name of a region and returns the total sales for that region.

getTotalSalesByRegion("east") -->  "Total sales for the east region were $780000 dollars."
getTotalSalesByRegion("west") -->  "Total sales for the west region were $385000 dollars."
*/



/*
LEVEL TWO
Modify your function so that it also takes in a rating. Your function should only return  the total sales for that region by sales people with the given rating.

getTotalSalesByRegion("west", "B") -->  105000
getTotalSalesByRegion("east", "A") -->  570000
getTotalSalesByRegion("east", "C") -->  0
